       "\"Charlotte Saunders, a young foster child, was reported missing from her home on Ruthven Road. Before her disappearance, she had been exhibiting noticeable personality changes. Charlotte often frequented the playground on Park Road, Ballachulish, with her friend. However, on the day she vanished, she left her phone at home, which was unusual for her. Her guardian mentioned she had recently been attending a dance studio on Moray Street, Blackford, which Charlotte described as a happy place. There were tensions around her child custody-related situation, which may have contributed to her unexpected journey. She was safely traced at a relative's house days later.\""
