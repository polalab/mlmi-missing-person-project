    "response": "narrative=Clive Clarke was last seen at 85 Bassett Avenue, Glasgow, G13 3JP, before embarking on a solo camping trip to a nearby campground. Known for taking periodic trips to unwind, Clive had informed his colleague about the getaway, promising to return by the weekend. However, when Clive failed to show up at work, his colleague Damien grew concerned and reported him missing. Despite extensive searches in the vicinity of known campgrounds, there were no initial signs of Clive. Four days later, police traced him to Main Road, G84 0AH, safe and well. Clive explained he had extended his camping trip unexpectedly due to new trail routes, unaware of the concern he had caused."
