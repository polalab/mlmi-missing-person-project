Her family became anxious after MP did not return home as expected. MP had previously expressed curiosity about the local cemetery she saw while passing through the area. Initial investigations led to the playground near her home, Oak Road, Birnam, Dunkeld, PH8 0BL, but no leads were found there. After extensive searches and collaboration with friends and family, MP was eventually located safe at a friend\u2019s residence on Caledonian Road, Perth, PH1 5XD. Local police facilitated her safe return to her family."
