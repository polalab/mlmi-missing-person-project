Before his disappearance, he had cut off all communications with family, including his mother and Steven Manning, his grandfather. Neil was last spotted near a military base, a place he was strangely drawn to despite his reticent nature. His uncle mentioned that Neil had a habit of retreating to forested areas to disconnect from the world.
