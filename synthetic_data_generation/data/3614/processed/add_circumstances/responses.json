Initial communications on the day of his disappearance indicated he had plans to attend evening classes.

His close friend, Ashleigh Stephenson, mentioned Leonard had been contemplating a more meaningful engagement with communities, potentially hinting at plans to forge his own path away from daily routines. Despite low concern levels at first due to his independent nature and low-risk assessment, as days passed without word, his father grew increasingly anxious.

Ultimately, Leonard was located by the police at an acquaintance's house at Panmure Terrace, seeming intent on rejuvenating and refocusing his life's vision."
