Her disappearance was complicated by the onset of foul weather, raising concerns about a possible boating incident. Witnesses nearby noted that Sian, along with her friends, had been seen playing near the shoreline close to 69-71 Whitehill Street, Musselburgh. Subsequent investigations suggested Sian might have been squatting temporarily at an abandoned structure near the coast with her friends. The poor weather impeded search efforts, but Sian was eventually traced by the police, ending her brief period of being unaccounted for."
