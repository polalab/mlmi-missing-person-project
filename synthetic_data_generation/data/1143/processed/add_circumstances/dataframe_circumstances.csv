On the day of her disappearance, Sheila was last seen at a fairground near the back road leading out of town. Her sister mentioned that Sheila seemed more withdrawn lately, often talking about exploring the nearby forested areas. A friend confirmed Sheila left the fairground alone, heading towards a secluded path believed to lead to a dense woodland. Surveillance footage later captured Sheila at a gas station along 484 Perth Road, Dundee, DD2 1LR, buying snacks before continuing on foot. Given Sheila's recent move and unfamiliarity with the area, there was significant concern for her safety. After a few tense days of searching, authorities found Sheila in the forested area, safe but disoriented, and she was promptly reunited with her family.",,"484 Perth Road Dundee DD2 1LR,312 Greengairs Road Greengairs","fairground,gas station,back road",,"sister,friend",,"believed to be in forested area,recently moved to area"
