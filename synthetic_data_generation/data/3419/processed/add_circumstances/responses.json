    "response": "narrative=Daniel Jones was last seen at his home on March Road, Buckie. His family, including his father Iain, became worried after Daniel, who has a noted disability, did not return home as expected. Initial assumptions suggested Daniel may have wandered towards Archiestown. Despite extensive searches, Daniel remained missing for several days. His absence prompted community-wide efforts to locate him. Eventually, Daniel was found by family members safe at an address on North Lane, Archiestown. It was determined that Daniel had become disoriented and unintentionally traveled to the location where he was ultimately traced."
