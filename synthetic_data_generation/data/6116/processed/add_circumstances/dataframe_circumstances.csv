The two had planned to attend a concert at a popular venue near 112-117 West Clyde Street, Helensburgh. Uncharacteristically, Ricky failed to meet Margaret at their designated spot. His foster mother grew concerned upon realizing that Ricky had not returned home the next day and reported him missing. Efforts by his foster father, with assistance from his colleague Jeffrey Smith, were in vain until police located Ricky at an address on Truce Road, safe but disoriented. The circumstances of his absence remain unexplained, raising questions among his peers and caregivers.",,"West Clyde Street Helensburgh,Street Helensburgh,Road",concert,,"foster father,foster mother,colleague","friend,colleague Jeffrey Smith,Margaret Briggs",
