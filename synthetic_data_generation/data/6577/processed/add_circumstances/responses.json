    "response": "\nnarrative=Jeremy Slater, a 15-year-old boy originally from Cardiff, went missing from his home at Gray Den, Dundee. Recently discharged from a care facility, Jeremy unexpectedly left his job at a local gym, which heightened concerns about his whereabouts. His foster father reported him missing after attempts to contact him failed. Before disappearing, Jeremy had been involved with a volunteer organization that frequently traveled to foreign countries. There was speculation he might have used those connections to leave, though no concrete evidence supported this. His friend, Eleanor Martin, mentioned Jeremy's growing desire for independence, which might have contributed to his sudden disappearance. Ultimately, Jeremy was later traced by his family to an address in Tayport."
