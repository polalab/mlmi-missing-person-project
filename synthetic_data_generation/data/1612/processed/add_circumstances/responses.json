    "response": "narrative=Hugh Parker was last seen at a train station, discussing upcoming music events with Donald O'Connor, a colleague. He appeared somewhat distracted, often checking his phone. It was later discovered Hugh had been in contact with an unknown online group, known for promoting misleading ideas, which concerned his family. Additionally, he had previously expressed an aversion to authorities, raising concerns about his whereabouts. A search led investigators to an abandoned bathroom at 4 Hillwood Terrace, Rosyth, KY11 2DJ, but there was no sign of Hugh. His grandmother, Jayne Morgan, worked closely with the police, resulting in Hugh's safe return after being found at 75 Nethergate, Crail, KY10 3TX."
