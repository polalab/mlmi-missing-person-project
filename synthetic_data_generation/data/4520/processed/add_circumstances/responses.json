    "response": "narrative=Gregory Smith, an 80-year-old who had begun withdrawing from family interactions, was reported missing from his home on Balmuildy Road, G64 3HD. When family visited, they found a note indicating his need for solitude and assumed he might have sought refuge to reflect on personal matters. A concerned friend noted Gregory's increasing isolation, hinting at visits to familiar places for peace, such as the adult day care near Fulton Road, G62 8PG. His sister and a close colleague coordinated with authorities to search common grounds. Police efforts led them to Stirling Road, Dumbarton, G82 3RG, but Gregory remained elusive. Days later, Gregory was traced in a calm state to an address on Main Road, G84 0AH. He was found safe, expressing a desire to reconnect slowly and promising to maintain more frequent contact with concerned loved ones."
