    "response": "narrative=Mark Johnson, a 47-year-old male, was reported missing from his home at 312 Greengairs Road, Greengairs. Initial inquiries revealed that Mark's brother, Toby Abbott, last saw him at the residence before leaving for a meeting. Mark's close friend, Clive, expressed concerns as Mark had been discussing feeling overwhelmed due to work pressures. He was known to go for long walks to clear his mind. Despite these worries, it was surprising when Mark did not attend a planned outing with his son, Allan Warren. Police were notified and after a search, Mark was traced to Gallanach Road, safe and cooperative with the officers."
