Prior to his disappearance, Conor had been in contact with Mandy regarding a planned visit to 1 Rennie's Isle, Edinburgh, where he often enjoyed peaceful walks by the waterside. However, he did not show up at the location, raising concerns. Mandy, familiar with his tendency to seek solitude to clear his mind, initially thought he might have taken a detour towards Easter Shawfair, Dalkeith, a place they both fondly recalled from childhood. Conor was eventually traced by police to 1 Tanfield, Edinburgh, appearing disoriented but unharmed, suggesting he had perhaps intended to stay away momentarily to deal with personal matters."
