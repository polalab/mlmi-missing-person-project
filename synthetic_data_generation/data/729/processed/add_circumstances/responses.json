Last seen at a popular shopping mall, Leslie made contact with a stranger before vanishing. Witnesses reported seeing Leslie near the entrance facing Knox Place, Haddington, EH41 4EB, where he conversed briefly with an unknown adult. This interaction led Leslie's guardians to believe he might have been lured away. The search extended over several areas, including The Cross, EH49 7AH, and 5 Pheasant Walk, North Berwick, EH39 5HX, as concerned locals joined the search efforts. Eventually, Leslie was traced to Kings Cairn, EH39 5HQ, safe and unharmed, thanks to the observation of vigilant staff."
