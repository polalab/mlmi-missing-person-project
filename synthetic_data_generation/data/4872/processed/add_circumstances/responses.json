    "response": "narrative=Gary O'Donnell, a 13-year-old boy, was last seen at a youth center before he went missing. As a foster child, Gary had become increasingly estranged from relatives and had no contact with close friends, making it difficult for authorities to gain insights into his whereabouts. Concern arose when Gary failed to arrive at a volunteer organization he often frequented for after-school activities. Initially presumed low risk, his disappearance quickly gained urgency as search efforts centered around addresses including 9 Kilcruik Road, Kinghorn, and 10-16 Wood Place, Rosyth. Ultimately, Gary was traced by police to 63 Parkside Street, Rosyth, and safely returned to his care team."

    "response": "narrative=Gary O'Donnell, an active 13-year-old, was last seen leaving his friend Oliver Holland's house, located at 42 Mid Shore, KY10 2NW. Before his disappearance, Gary was known to be estranged from his relatives, having little to no contact with close friends. On the evening he went missing, Gary was supposed to join some peers for a casual gathering, but he never showed up. His usual routine involved visiting nearby locations like a gas station and a national park. However, on this occasion, a comprehensive search in these areas yielded no clues. His foster parents reported him missing after several attempts to contact him went unanswered. Days later, he was eventually traced by police to Carnegie Avenue, Dunfermline, KY11 8PJ. During the days he was missing, he didn't reach out to anyone he knew, raising questions about his motives and state of mind at the time."
