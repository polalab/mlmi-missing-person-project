As a foster child, Gary had become increasingly estranged from relatives and had no contact with close friends, making it difficult for authorities to gain insights into his whereabouts. Concern arose when Gary failed to arrive at a volunteer organization he often frequented for after-school activities. Initially presumed low risk, his disappearance quickly gained urgency as search efforts centered around addresses including 9 Kilcruik Road, Kinghorn, and 10-16 Wood Place, Rosyth. Ultimately, Gary was traced by police to 63 Parkside Street, Rosyth, and safely returned to his care team.","youth center,volunteer organization","9 Kilcruik Road Kinghorn,Wood Place Rosyth",,,,,"estranged from relatives,no contact with close friends",0,NULL,0,NULL,1,He is vulnerable due to being only 13 years of age and in foster care.,0,NULL,0,NULL,1,He may have issues interacting as he has become estranged from relatives and friends.,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,1,He has become estranged from relatives which may indicate family conflict.,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,1,His disappearance behavior was unusual as he failed to arrive at a known location.,0,NULL,0,NULL,1,He intended to attend a volunteer organization but did not complete this.,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL
