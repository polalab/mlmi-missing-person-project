    "response": "narrative=Karen Metcalfe was last observed at a construction site near 3B Balmakeith Industrial Estate, IV12 5QW. Having left her home in Inverness with minimal explanation to her daughter who was visiting, no immediate concern was raised due to her often nonchalant outings to varied locations. However, when Karen did not return that night, family members, including her concerned uncle, sought to contact her with no avail. Subsequent inquiries revealed that she had intended to make a stop at a local sports league, but there was no confirmation of her arrival. Over the days following her absence, unease grew as coordinated searches failed to yield any trace of her. Family reported sightings to lead investigators back to construction site areas she frequented, where she was finally located unharmed. The disappearance remains a perplexing incident for those involved."
