    "response": "narrative=Albert Russell, a 94-year-old male with a recognized disability, went missing from a pharmacy on West Clyde Street, Helensburgh. Before his disappearance, Albert mentioned to his friend, Eric, about attending a gathering at the community center located along Main Road, G84 0AH. Fellow attendees reported seeing Albert distractedly wandering near the cliffs behind the synagogue. Concerns were raised as his grandmother used to caution about his fascination with heights. Realizing Albert hadn't returned, Eric and another friend of Albert's volunteered to comb the nearby area. Despite their determined search near Belsyde Avenue, Glasgow, G15 6AR, Albert remained elusive. His extended absence prompted a public appeal until a vigilant community member discovered him disoriented on Bassett Avenue, Glasgow."

Living at 85 Bassett Avenue, Glasgow, Albert found himself increasingly isolated. On the day of his disappearance, he was last seen by neighbors walking towards Block 1 Acre Road, Glasgow. Following an alert raised by concerned community staff, a search ensued. Albert was located several days later by a member of the public in Rhu, far from his usual surroundings. It appeared that Albert had been disoriented and wandered off, seeking solitude during this emotionally challenging time."

    "response": "narrative=Albert Russell was last seen at his residence on Castlecary Road, G68 0HD. Following a recent bereavement, Albert had become notably withdrawn, even discontinuing his part-time involvement with the university. Concerned, a friend visited his home only to find a note suggesting a desire to find solace elsewhere. Rumor had it he frequented a small community gathering at 224-226 Archerhill Road, Glasgow, G13 3YX, but on the day of his disappearance, he failed to appear. Albert's absence from this routine concerned his neighbor and colleagues. The police continued their search and eventually located Albert safe at an acquaintance's residence on Bassett Avenue. While the circumstances that led to his disappearance were deeply personal, the familiarity of his eventual location brought immediate relief to those who knew him."

    "response": "narrative=Albert Russell, known to have withdrawn from university long ago and affected recently by the bereavement of his wife, was last seen near a cliff located at Block 1 Acre Road, Glasgow. A conversation with a colleague earlier suggested he was dealing with overwhelming feelings of loss. Witnesses reported seeing him walking along the cliff's edge, seemingly deep in thought. Albert's familiarity with the area was notable, yet his absence from known locales raised concern. Following his disappearance, efforts to locate him included a search around 1a The Auld Road, but it was only after several days that Albert was traced by police, unharmed, and engaging quietly in a nearby neighborhood."
