The search extended to nearby volunteer organizations, and there were initial concerns about her being lost in the terrain given its complexity. Rosemary was eventually traced by staff to an address on Newtonmore Road, Kingussie, safe and unharmed, yet she remained quiet about the time spent missing."

    "response": "narrative=Rosemary Wright, also known as MP, was reported missing from her home in Gleneagles. Prior to her disappearance, she had expressed interest in exploring remote areas, specifically mentioning a fascination with both the desert and swamp landscapes. On the day she went missing, she was last known to have visited a local hospital for a routine check-up, but she never returned home. Her daughter, concerned by her absence, contacted authorities when MP failed to arrive at an arranged meeting. Among the theories considered, it was postulated that MP might have embarked on an unplanned journey to one of the nearby swamps, known for its isolated trails. After extensive searches through these remote areas, particularly focusing on stretches surrounding hospital routes, police successfully located Rosemary three days later, unharmed and taking photographs of obscure desert plant life."

    "response": "narrative=Rosemary Wright was last seen leaving her home in Gleneagles, often taking walks to clear her mind. She regularly visited areas near the border, including a stretch of desert terrain she found tranquil. Rosemary's sister became concerned when she failed to return home or answer any calls. Lacking communication, the sister contacted Joanne, a close friend, who confirmed Rosemary often enjoyed solitude in these remote spots. Concern grew as time passed, prompting the family to alert authorities. Later, a member of the public recognized Rosemary on Newtonmore Road in Kingussie and notified local authorities, ensuring her safe return. She was found unharmed but disoriented."
