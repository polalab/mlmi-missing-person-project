Known for occasionally veering off-course during outings, Peter was unaccounted for when the group reconvened to depart. As night approached, his absence was reported, but a thorough search of the amusement park revealed no trace. A lead arose when a witness mentioned a boy matching Peter's description wandering into an alleyway near the nearby youth center. The police traced Peter within a day, finding him safe in an alleyway not far from Caledonian Road. Peter's quick disappearance was a reminder of the challenges he faced and the vigilance needed in group settings.","youth center,school",,"amusement park,alleyway",,"colleague,colleague",,
