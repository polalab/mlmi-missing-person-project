Known for occasionally veering off-course during outings, Peter was unaccounted for when the group reconvened to depart. As night approached, his absence was reported, but a thorough search of the amusement park revealed no trace. A lead arose when a witness mentioned a boy matching Peter's description wandering into an alleyway near the nearby youth center. The police traced Peter within a day, finding him safe in an alleyway not far from Caledonian Road. Peter's quick disappearance was a reminder of the challenges he faced and the vigilance needed in group settings.","youth center,school",,"amusement park,alleyway",,"colleague,colleague",,,0,NULL,0,NULL,1,"Although Peter is 13 years old, he has a disability which increases his vulnerability.",1,Peter may have specific medical needs that could be adversely affected without medication.,1,Peter has a disability which may include mental health or developmental challenges.,1,"Known to occasionally veer off-course, indicating difficulty in unfamiliar situations.",0,NULL,0,NULL,0,Weather conditions were not indicated as a risk factor.,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,1,His disappearance during an outing is different from normal behavior patterns.,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,1,Peter has a disability which often correlates with mental health challenges.,0,NULL
