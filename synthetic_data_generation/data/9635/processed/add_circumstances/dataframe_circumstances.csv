On the day of his disappearance, he was supposed to be at Inchmarlo Road, Banchory, for a scheduled session at a tutoring center. However, he never arrived. A colleague, Heather Morgan, mentioned seeing Dean near 10 East Cathcart Street, possibly contemplating his next steps, before heading towards the marina.
