    "response": "narrative=Dean Murray went missing following a visit to the dock/marina area with two friends, one being Christine Williams. Dean had recently faced a romantic rejection, and friends noticed he had been increasingly withdrawn afterward. His peers reported that his mental health had been a concern, given his background of family displacement and custody transitions, especially after his placement in foster care. On the day of his disappearance, he was supposed to be at Inchmarlo Road, Banchory, for a scheduled session at a tutoring center. However, he never arrived. A colleague, Heather Morgan, mentioned seeing Dean near 10 East Cathcart Street, possibly contemplating his next steps, before heading towards the marina. Ultimately, he was located in Insch by police and safely returned."

    "response": "narrative=Dean Murray, a 15-year-old, went missing from his home in Archiestown. The disappearance occurred shortly after a heated argument with Sara Wilkinson, a colleague of his foster parent. This discussion involved romantic rejection, which deeply affected Dean. In his distress, Dean was last seen near a skate park, not far from the cult location at Gordon Crescent, AB34 5HJ. Concerns about his welfare grew, given the child custody-related tensions surrounding his foster situation. Fortunately, after a thorough search effort by the police, Dean was found unharmed at Golden Knowes Road, where a friend had reported seeing him."

    "response": "narrative=Dean Murray was found to have left his home on North Lane, Archiestown, without informing his foster father. A friend reported that Dean had been grappling with romantic rejection and mental health issues prior to his disappearance. He was known to travel without informing family, which raised concerns when he was not seen for several days. Dean was last spotted near the skate park on Inchmarlo Road, Banchory, AB31 4AB, a location he frequented often. Multiple searches at local hangouts, including the tutoring center and sports club, yielded no signs of him. Eventually, police traced Dean to Bog Road, where he was safely recovered and reunited with his foster family."
