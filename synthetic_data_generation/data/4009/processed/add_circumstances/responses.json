    "response": "narrative=Duncan Woods was last seen by his son, shortly after expressing a sudden religious conversion that took them both by surprise. Known for occasionally using aliases during online interactions, Duncan had recently communicated with an unfamiliar group, raising concerns about his safety. On the day of his disappearance, he was believed to be heading towards Park Road, Ballachulish, PH49 4JS, an area reportedly known for gang activity. Fears grew when Duncan did not appear at a scheduled outing to an amusement park with colleague Dawn Blake. He was eventually traced by police at 22-24 Whitefriars Street, Perth, PH1 1PP, five days later. Family members and friends were relieved when Duncan was found safe, albeit now more withdrawn and quietly reflective."

    "response": "narrative=Duncan Woods was last seen at an amusement park with his son, Timothy Jackson. Prior to his disappearance, he engaged in an online interaction that seemed to preoccupy him. Witnesses reported seeing him wander away from the group near a pharmacy at 37-39 York Place, Perth, PH2 8EH. Due to his disability, concerns grew quickly. Timothy alerted authorities after failing to locate him in nearby areas, including senior housing at 1-8 Telford Gardens, PH8 0QA. Woods was later found by another visitor at Inver, Dunkeld, PH8 0JR."

    "response": "narrative=Duncan Woods, a 72-year-old retired officer, was reported missing from his home at Phoines Estate, Newtonmore. Known for his frequent ventures to old acquaintances, it was not unusual for him to go missing for brief periods. On this occasion, a colleague, Arthur Williams, mentioned Duncan's recent interest in visiting an amusement park situated within a known gang territory. This raised immediate concerns given his age and physical limitations. His vehicle was found parked near the adult day care at 60 South William Street, Perth, which was unusual for his routine visits. Friends and family grew worried, and searches were conducted across multiple locations, including 22 The Square and Newtonmore Road. After a thorough investigation by the police, Duncan was fortunately traced to Inver, Dunkeld, unharmed, yet disoriented, much to the relief of all involved."
