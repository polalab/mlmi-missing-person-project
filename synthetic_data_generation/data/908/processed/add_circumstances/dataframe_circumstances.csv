The last sighting of Kelly was near the school bus stop on Mayne Road. Her family, particularly her grandmother and sister, heightened their worries because of Kelly's pattern of disengagement. It wasn't until she missed extracurricular activities that immediate alarm bells rang. Police found traces of her on Sir Walter Scott Drive, near a military base, but no direct sightings. A later trace placed her at a shed close to the base, indicating a possible unintended exploration gone awry. Kelly was eventually found safe on Millburn Road in Inverness, where she had been staying with a friend named Clare Rahman, who offered comfort after Kelly sought refuge from her familial estrangement.",extracurricular activities,"Inverness,Sir Walter Scott Drive","military base,shed,school bus stop",Clare Rahman,"grandmother,sister,friend",,estranged from relatives
