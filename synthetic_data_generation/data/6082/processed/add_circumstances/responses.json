    "response": "narrative=Joseph Bradshaw was last seen by a colleague after a night out. He had a scheduled medical appointment at 541 South Road, Dundee, but did not arrive. His friend expressed concern when he missed a carpool group meeting at 71 Lothian Crescent, Dundee. Tracy Smith, his sister, mentioned that Joseph had recently shown signs of stress. After being traced by staff, it was determined that Joseph had voluntarily taken time to reflect on his mental health but was in good condition."
