Her colleague, Sharon Lucas, had earlier expressed concern about Jemma's visits to remote islands, which she frequently undertook without informing anyone. On this occasion, Jemma was last seen near a gang territory at An t-Sr\u00e0id, PA34 5UG. It was suspected that she might have been squatting in abandoned structures in the area. As Jemma was known to be independent and resourceful, these activities seemed plausible. However, her absence raised alarms. She was later found by a member of the public at Gallanach Road, PA34 4PE, unharmed but disoriented, and returned safely home."
