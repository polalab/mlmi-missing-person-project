    "response": "narrative=Colin Hall, a thirteen-year-old from a foster home located at 63-65 Truce Road, Glasgow, vanished under unusual circumstances. Known for his interest in survivalist activities and a tendency to seek solitude, Colin was last seen after finishing a meal with a friend at a local restaurant, perhaps preparing for his seasonal work role on a cruise ship. Colleagues, including Raymond Arnold, noticed his absence on the ship and raised the alarm when he failed to return. His fondness for solitude and survival skills may have led him to explore the nearby wilderness. Authorities began searching for Colin, eventually tracing him to Belsyde Avenue."

    "response": "narrative=Colin Hall, a part of the survivalist community, mysteriously vanished during his seasonal work stint. Having a reputation for adventurous endeavors, Colin would often spend weekends with colleagues exploring unknown territories. On one occasion, he was heard discussing a visit to an amusement park and planning a meal at a popular restaurant. However, mid-week, Colin unexpectedly disappeared after leaving his home for a part-time job. His absence was noted by a concerned colleague, who found it unlike Colin to not show up without notice. Despite the initial low-risk assessment, worry grew as Colin remained untraceable. Eventually, he was found safe by a member of the public at a different address, miles from where he was last seen."
