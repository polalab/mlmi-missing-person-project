Having a reputation for adventurous endeavors, Colin would often spend weekends with colleagues exploring unknown territories. On one occasion, he was heard discussing a visit to an amusement park and planning a meal at a popular restaurant. However, mid-week, Colin unexpectedly disappeared after leaving his home for a part-time job. His absence was noted by a concerned colleague, who found it unlike Colin to not show up without notice. Despite the initial low-risk assessment, worry grew as Colin remained untraceable.
