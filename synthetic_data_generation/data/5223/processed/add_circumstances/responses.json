    "response": "narrative=Samantha Murphy, a 12-year-old, was last seen at her home on Craigieknowes Road, Perth. Her disappearance created a sense of urgency due to her young age. Her foster father, who had a routine of checking in frequently, noticed she had left behind no note, which was out of character. A colleague from her foster father's workplace mentioned that she had talked about airplanes recently. This hint led investigators to consider the possibility that Samantha might have been motivated by a fascination with aviation. Despite initial fears, Samantha was eventually traced by police at Park Road, Ballachulish, safely. Her motive for disappearing remains unclear, but she appeared unharmed."
