Known to have unpaid debts, he had been acting peculiarly, and family members suspected he might be squatting to avoid creditors.

Inquiries revealed that he was often seen around a closet space in a property known to be vacant along A939, Corgarff. Concerned for his safety due to his disability and age, local authorities were notified. With the help of his friend, Billy Burton, authorities finally traced him to a nearby location on Bog Road. Lawrence was found safe but weary. Despite his circumstances, he was returned home, where arrangements were made to address the issues that led to his disappearance."
