    "response": "narrative=Callum Moore, a retired counseling psychologist with a known disability, had left his job unexpectedly, surprising his family including his sister Zoe Moore. On what seemed like a routine walk from Newtonmore Road, where he regularly enjoyed brisk walks, Callum was last seen leaving the parking lot at Strathview Gardens, Pitlochry, perhaps distracted or deep in thought. Despite the low initial risk assessed, his unexpected departure and subsequent failure to return home led to a concerned report from his family. Initial searches focused around his known walking routes, but it wasn't until his sister played a crucial role in retracing his possible steps that he was located in a different part of Pitlochry, safe and unharmed."

    "response": "narrative=Callum Moore, known for his creative works and online activity, went missing from Lundy Gardens, Fort William. His son reported him absent from their planned visit to an assisted living facility. Investigating officers later found evidence of Callum's involvement with an unknown online group, raising concerns about his whereabouts. The search extended to snowy regions and near the ocean, particularly around Newtonmore Road, Kingussie. After two days, Callum was discovered safe in Blackford, unharmed but evasive about his time missing. The circumstances suggest a voluntary disappearance linked to his creative ventures and online connections."
