    "response": "narrative=Ross Bennett, known for his adventurous spirit, was last spotted leaving his home at 2 Dalgleish Road, Dundee, following an argument with his foster mother. Witnesses reported that shortly after, a young male resembling Ross boarded a ferry from the coastal beach area. This prompted concerns about possible foreign travel. Earlier in the day, Ross was supposed to meet his colleague, Colin Middleton, at a tutoring center but never showed up. A local resident mentioned seeing a boy matching Ross's description near the entrance of a nearby mountain trail. The investigation also considered sightings near storm drains off Findcastle Street, Dundee. Police launched a search, concerned about Ross's whereabouts, and found clues suggesting he might have traveled between these locations."
