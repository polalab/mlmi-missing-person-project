Her tendency to seek solace in isolation prompted discussions with her grandmother and grandfather, Maurice Dixon, who noticed changes in her behavior. They speculated she might have headed to a remote cabin known to her past visits, possibly to connect with a commune at St Margaretâ€™s Head, North Queensferry. Sian's history of trauma hinted she sought a sense of community or solace away from her daily responsibilities. Concerns grew when she missed a family meeting, prompting searches by her relatives.
