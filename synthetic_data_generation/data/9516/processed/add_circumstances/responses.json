It was believed that he might have wandered off, possibly disoriented. The search led authorities to various potential locations based on recent interests Tom had expressed. First, attention was directed towards an abandoned boat near 66 Kirkbank Road, Burntisland, where Tom had been seen exploring weeks prior. Concurrently, a tip suggested checking a storm drain on the outskirts of Rosyth, as Tom had previously spoken about nearby hidden tunnels.
