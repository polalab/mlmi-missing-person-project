She had planned to visit a friend at 52a Sinclair Street, Helensburgh, G84 8TQ but never arrived. Concerns grew as Sandra, who was under a foster care arrangement, had a history of wandering due to her unspecified disability. Initial sightings placed her near 1a The Auld Road, G67 2RF, where a local reported seeing a girl matching her description disoriented and asking for directions. It was believed that Sandra became confused and unintentionally strayed further from her intended destination. Her high-risk status prompted a swift search operation, leading to her being located safely and returned to her guardians."

    "response": "narrative=Sandra Simpson, a 16-year-old under foster care, was initially reported missing from her address on 21 Rampart Avenue, Glasgow. She was last seen at a friend's house earlier in the day, displaying emotional distress. Sandra's foster father reported that she had been struggling recently and frequently sought solitude in unconventional places, such as closets, to escape her reality. Despite having a low initial risk level, her disappearance raised concerns due to her disability and recent attendance at a local rehab center. The urban environment of Fulton Road, with its complex network of streets, was searched thoroughly by authorities, but Sandra remained elusive. Thankfully, she was eventually located by police on Stirling Road, Dumbarton, safe and unharmed."
