She had planned to visit a friend at 52a Sinclair Street, Helensburgh, G84 8TQ but never arrived. Concerns grew as Sandra, who was under a foster care arrangement, had a history of wandering due to her unspecified disability. Initial sightings placed her near 1a The Auld Road, G67 2RF, where a local reported seeing a girl matching her description disoriented and asking for directions. It was believed that Sandra became confused and unintentionally strayed further from her intended destination.
