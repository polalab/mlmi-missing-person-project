    "response": "narrative=Elliott Williams, a 91-year-old retired health visitor, was reported missing from his home at 90 Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh. Known to avoid authorities, Elliott was living in an assisted living facility and was suspected to have quietly left his residence without informing the staff or any acquaintances, including his friend Ian Smith. Initially deemed low risk due to his calm demeanor and familiarity with the area, the prolonged absence raised concerns among those who knew him. His behavioral pattern suggested a desire for solitude, occasionally evading official notice. The facility's staff, noticing his absence, reached out to Ian Smith, who had not heard from Wyatt. After almost a day of searching, police traced him back to his residence, safe and unharmed, having returned unnoticed."

    "response": "narrative=Elliott Williams, a 91-year-old individual, was reported missing from his home at 90 Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh. Concerns were raised after he failed to return from a casual outing planned near a military base. His sister and colleague, Nathan Robinson, became worried and reached out to the authorities, fearing a possible sea kayaking accident had occurred near North Berwick. Given his age and disability, the risk level was initially high. A search around locations he frequented, including Pheasant Walk and Cluny Drive, was initiated. After days of intensive efforts by search teams and local authorities, Elliott was thankfully located at 61 Old Abbey Road by police, approximately three days later, safe and unharmed."
