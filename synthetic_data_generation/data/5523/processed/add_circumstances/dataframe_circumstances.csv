Known to avoid authorities, Elliott was living in an assisted living facility and was suspected to have quietly left his residence without informing the staff or any acquaintances, including his friend Ian Smith. Initially deemed low risk due to his calm demeanor and familiarity with the area, the prolonged absence raised concerns among those who knew him. His behavioral pattern suggested a desire for solitude, occasionally evading official notice. The facility's staff, noticing his absence, reached out to Ian Smith, who had not heard from Wyatt. After almost a day of searching, police traced him back to his residence, safe and unharmed, having returned unnoticed.",assisted living facility,,,,,Ian Smith,known to avoid authorities
