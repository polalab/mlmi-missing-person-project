He was last seen by a friend and his colleague, Darren Simpson, at the nearby skate park. Known for his adventurous nature, concerns arose when he did not return home as expected. The search extended to various locales, including Darren Simpson's workplace and 21 Rampart Avenue, yet each lead fell short. While the initial risk level was considered low, the family feared Dale might have been exploring without supervision. After multiple days and ongoing family efforts, Dale was finally located safe on Balmuildy Road, having wandered there while exploring new routes.","skate park,Home","21 Rampart Avenue,Truce Road Glasgow",,,"friend,friend",colleague Darren Simpson,,0,NULL,0,NULL,1,"Dale is only 9 years old, making him vulnerable in unfamiliar situations.",0,NULL,0,NULL,1,He may struggle in unfamiliar circumstances due to his young age.,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,1,Dale's absence for an extended period was unusual compared to normal behavior.,0,NULL,0,NULL,1,Dale intended to explore the skate park but failed to return home.,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL
