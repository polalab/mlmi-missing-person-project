On that day, she was expected to return home after the session but did not show up. After her absence was noted, her brother, Allan Robinson, contacted the police expressing concern about her sudden disappearance. Multiple efforts to locate her were initiated, focusing initially around Hospital Street, Perth, where she occasionally visited a colleague. Days later, her family managed to trace her to a residence at 10 Garden Wood, Inchmarlo. It appears Bethany had voluntarily gone to seek solitude without informing her close contacts, leading to the incident being reported. She was found safe and sound, with no harm done.","Home,running group","Hospital Street Perth,Railway Pier Oban",,,"colleague,brother",Allan Robinson,
