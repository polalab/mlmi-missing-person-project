    "response": "narrative=Bethany Hope was last seen at her residence on 312 Greengairs Road, Greengairs, where she lived with her daughter, Patricia Wilson. Concern arose when she didn't return home from a short trip to Railway Pier, Oban, PA34 4LW, a location she was known to visit occasionally. Julia Smith, a close friend, mentioned Bethany had confided in her about feeling overwhelmed by personal matters. Prior to her disappearance, Bethany had communicated with her sister, Katherine Hope, who had recently been visiting Hospital Street, Perth, PH2 8HP. Despite efforts to contact her, Bethany remained unreachable. After an extensive search, Bethany was eventually traced by police in Leargan, Leven. Her disappearance remained unexplained, though her family expressed relief at her safe return."

    "response": "narrative=Bethany Hope was last seen at Railway Pier, Oban, where her running group met regularly. On that day, she was expected to return home after the session but did not show up. After her absence was noted, her brother, Allan Robinson, contacted the police expressing concern about her sudden disappearance. Multiple efforts to locate her were initiated, focusing initially around Hospital Street, Perth, where she occasionally visited a colleague. Days later, her family managed to trace her to a residence at 10 Garden Wood, Inchmarlo. It appears Bethany had voluntarily gone to seek solitude without informing her close contacts, leading to the incident being reported. She was found safe and sound, with no harm done."
