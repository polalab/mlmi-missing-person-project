    "response": "narrative=Victoria Holden, a young child who lived in a converted van, went missing from her foster home at 6 Bard Avenue, Glasgow. On the day she disappeared, her friend Maureen Davies recalled seeing Victoria playing near 55 Diana Avenue. Both addresses were located close to her foster home. Her friend noticed nothing unusual at the time. Victoria was known for participating in various extracurricular activities, often commuting in the van her foster family used. On the day of her disappearance, she was supposed to join her friend Annette for such an activity but never showed up. When police began their search, they focused on known hangouts, including the gym on Archerhill Road. After an extensive search, Victoria was safely traced by the police to Belsyde Avenue. Her time away remained a mystery, with no indication of foul play or evidence to suggest she left the area voluntarily."

    "response": "narrative=Victoria Holden was last sighted leaving a dance studio, allegedly heading towards a lake situated near 55 Diana Avenue, Glasgow, G13 3JW. The initial inquiries suggest that she might have been drawn to this location after overhearing a conversation between her colleagues at the studio about a spontaneous gathering by the bridge overlooking the lake. Nathan Gilbert, a colleague, mentioned that Victoria seemed eager to participate. Given her age and the fact that she was under foster care, concerns grew rapidly, prompting authorities to issue a higher risk assessment. After an exhaustive search around the lake and nearby ocean areas, she was finally traced by police on Castlecary Road, safe and unharmed."
