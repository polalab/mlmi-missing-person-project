On the day of his disappearance, staff at the 6 Lownie Road address in Forfar last saw him head for the train station, carrying a bag that suggested he may have intended to visit 71 Lothian Crescent in Dundee, a place tied to his volunteer work. Despite his age and disability, Nathan was known to be quite independent. When he did not return home as expected, concerns grew. After being reported missing, he was eventually found safe on St Mary's Lane, Newport-on-Tay thanks to alert staff.","neighborhood cafe,volunteer work","71 Lothian Crescent Dundee,6 Lownie Road",train,,,,,0.0,NULL,0.0,NULL,1.0,"Due to his age of 80 and having a disability, he is considered vulnerable.",0.0,NULL,1.0,He has a disability that could affect his health and safety.,0.0,NULL,0.0,NULL,0.0,NULL,0.0,NULL,0.0,NULL,0.0,NULL,0.0,NULL,0.0,NULL,0.0,NULL,0.0,NULL,0.0,NULL,1.0,Going missing for this length was unusual for him as he was independent and reliable.,0.0,NULL,0.0,NULL,1.0,He intended to visit a place associated with his volunteer work but did not return.,0.0,NULL,0.0,NULL,0.0,NULL,0.0,NULL,0.0,NULL
