    "response": "narrative=Bernard Perkins, a lively 11-year-old, was reported missing from his home on Dundee Road, Arbroath. On the day of his disappearance, Bernard had plans to meet his friend, Donna Thomas, at the local skate park. He often spent hours there practicing tricks and enjoying the company of peers. Donna waited but Bernard never showed up. A concerned colleague of Bernard\u2019s guardian recalled a conversation where Bernard mentioned wanting to catch a movie later in the day at the nearby movie theater. Upon further investigation, none of the theater staff or visitors recalled seeing him there. The breakthrough came when someone remembered Bernard talking excitedly about meeting new friends at the skate park. This spurred a search leading to Bernard being traced in Dundee, safe but confused about the fuss his whereabouts caused. Police found him slightly disoriented yet unharmed, bringing relief to his guardian and friends."

    "response": "narrative=Bernard Perkins, an 11-year-old boy, was reported missing after he failed to return home from a visit to the library with his friend, Alexandra Myers, in Dundee. Bernard was supposed to meet his foster parent at their home in Arbroath but did not arrive as expected. Concern grew when Bernard's usual confidant, his friend Donna Thomas, admitted she hadn't heard from him since the library visit. Police investigations began at the library and expanded to nearby areas, including Turnberry Avenue and 16 Cleghorn Street, as clues suggested Bernard may have ventured into unfamiliar locations. He was eventually traced by police at East School Road in Dundee, unharmed."
