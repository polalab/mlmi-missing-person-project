On the day of his disappearance, Bernard had plans to meet his friend, Donna Thomas, at the local skate park. He often spent hours there practicing tricks and enjoying the company of peers. Donna waited but Bernard never showed up. A concerned colleague of Bernardâ€™s guardian recalled a conversation where Bernard mentioned wanting to catch a movie later in the day at the nearby movie theater. Upon further investigation, none of the theater staff or visitors recalled seeing him there. The breakthrough came when someone remembered Bernard talking excitedly about meeting new friends at the skate park. This spurred a search leading to Bernard being traced in Dundee, safe but confused about the fuss his whereabouts caused. Police found him slightly disoriented yet unharmed, bringing relief to his guardian and friends.","skate park,movie theater",,,,"friend,colleague,colleague",friend Donna Thomas,
