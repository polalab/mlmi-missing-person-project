    "response": "narrative=Jayne Read was last seen leaving her home in Murrayshall, Perth (PH2 7PL), by a colleague. It was not unusual for her to take solitary walks along Riggs Road, Perth (PH1 1PR), often wandering into the nearby hunting area. On the day she went missing, her colleague mentioned she seemed intrigued by the scenic route alongside the river, potentially heading towards the playground at Moray Street, Blackford (PH4 1QF). Speculation arose that Jayne may have lost track of time, drawn by the tranquility of nature. When she did not return, concerns grew. Successfully traced days later, she explained that she had taken an unplanned extended retreat, opting to disconnect and temporarily escape her routine, ultimately leading to her disappearance."
