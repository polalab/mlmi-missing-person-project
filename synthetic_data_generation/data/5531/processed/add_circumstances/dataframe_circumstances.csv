The 91-year-old had been preparing for his routine book club meeting with his sister. However, his sister found out he never arrived. Friends mentioned Stephen's frequent visits to Stirling Road, Dumbarton, yet he neither appeared nor contacted anyone. Concerns grew due to his age and suspected visa issues possibly leading to foreign travel. His overdue return from a usual walk was particularly alarming. Kelly, a close friend, raised the alarm when no one heard from him since he had talked about visiting a mosque previously. The police later located him at Acre Drive, Glasgow.","book club,mosque","Stirling Road Dumbarton,Avenue Glasgow",,Kelly,"friend,friend,sister",,"suspected visa issues,foreign travel suspected,overdue return from walk"
