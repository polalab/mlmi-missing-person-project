He had mentioned his eagerness to explore the nearby mountains, a place he had always been fascinated by. After the movie, a colleague of his guardian reported that Ben seemed particularly quiet, preoccupied with thoughts of a recent family outing to a beach. It was not until later that evening that Ben's absence from his foster home was noted. The search operation was initiated quickly, but it wasn't until his family received a tip-off that they located him on Beltie Road.
