Known for his interest in a hermit lifestyle, Ben withdrew a surprising amount of cash before leaving. His behavior had been increasingly withdrawn, though it didn't raise significant concern given his history of preferring solitude. After failing to show up at predetermined locations like March Road in Buckie, his friends and a concerned colleague contributed to heightened worry. Ben was eventually traced by the police at an address on North High Street. It appeared he sought solitude without realizing the distress his disappearance caused, yet was safely returned without incident."

    "response": "narrative=Ben Carter was last seen at a ski resort near the ocean, set against a mountainous backdrop. His disappearance sparked concern among foster care authorities due to his young age and high initial risk level. Earlier in the day, Ben was with friends enjoying a movie at a theater close to Gordon Crescent, AB34 5HJ. He had mentioned his eagerness to explore the nearby mountains, a place he had always been fascinated by. After the movie, a colleague of his guardian reported that Ben seemed particularly quiet, preoccupied with thoughts of a recent family outing to a beach. It was not until later that evening that Ben's absence from his foster home was noted. The search operation was initiated quickly, but it wasn't until his family received a tip-off that they located him on Beltie Road. Throughout his time missing, Ben had sought solace by retracing steps reminiscent of happier memories shared with his biological family."
