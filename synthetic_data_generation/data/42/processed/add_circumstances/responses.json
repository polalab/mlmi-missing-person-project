    "response": "narrative=Kate Connolly was reported missing from her home on Craigour Road, Torphins. She had exhibited noticeable personality changes prior to her disappearance. Friends, including Peter and Georgina Yates, mentioned Kate's interest in camping, possibly contributing to her unexpected disappearance. Alerts were issued following her disappearance due to her age and foster care status. The search led authorities to believe she was located near a cemetery. During an intensive search operation, Kate was finally found at 10 Garden Wood, Inchmarlo, a site known to be frequented for camping activities. Trace operations by police confirmed Kate had been in the area with a group of friends who were similarly interested in outdoor adventures, thus explaining her temporary absence."
