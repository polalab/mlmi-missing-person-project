He had been experiencing tension at home, reported to be domestic violence-related, but had not disclosed specific issues to his friend. Mohammed was known for his structured routine around his job, and his sudden failure to follow his regular commute raised concerns. Subsequently, it was discovered he had left his passport and important documents behind, signaling a sudden and unanticipated departure. Additionally, attempts to reach him proved futile as he had cut off communications. His absence prompted a search, eventually locating him in the stairwell at Kinghorn Road, Burntisland, KY3 9LL."

His sister and friend were concerned when they realized he had left his passport and documents behind, crucial items he\u2019d never typically forget if planning travel. These were found at the top of the stairwell, suggesting an unexpected departure.

His brother mentioned Mohammed was last seen discussing personal matters with Jennifer Ali, a colleague, indicating potential stress factors. Days later, police safely traced Mohammed at a different address."
