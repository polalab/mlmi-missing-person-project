    "response": "narrative=Paul Charlton was last seen leaving his residence at 1 Tanfield, Edinburgh. Known for occasionally visiting safe houses, concerns arose when he failed to contact his sister, Josephine Charlton, as expected. Initial investigations led authorities to Clovenstone Park, Edinburgh, but no conclusive evidence was found. As the days passed, colleague Charles Robinson reported having brief discussions with Paul about staying at a specific safe house for privacy. A rigorous search traced Paul to 13 Moray Way, where he had taken refuge after feeling overwhelmed by his circumstances at home. Found safe and sound, he explained his need for some time alone, and with assistance from the proper channels, he returned home, amicably resolved with family and friends."
