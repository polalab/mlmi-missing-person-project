    "response": "narrative=Chloe Allen was last seen by her friend Hayley Read near the cliff overlooking Seaforth Place, Burntisland. Prior to her disappearance, Chloe had expressed an interest in visiting the nearby zoo, located on School Lane, Hillend. Her foster family reported that she had been upset lately, possibly due to personal issues related to her circumstances, but didn't consider it unusual until she failed to return home. Lawrence Fleming, a colleague of her foster mother, mentioned calling Chloe and hearing the sounds of the zoo in the background. This led the search effort to concentrate around these areas. Chloe's determination and adventurous spirit prompted concerns about her safety near the cliff and in their efforts to locate her quickly, her family and friends worked diligently until she was safely traced by family members several days later."
