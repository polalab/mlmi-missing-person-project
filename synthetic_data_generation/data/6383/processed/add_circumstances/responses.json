    "response": "narrative=Jay Johnson was reported missing from his residence on Greengairs Road by his sister after he failed to return home and could not be contacted. Jay, known for travelling without informing his family, often took spontaneous trips, which initially did not alarm his relatives. However, when days passed without any communication, his sister grew concerned and involved the police. Investigations revealed that Jay had been spending time with a friend, Danielle Moore, in North Berwick. Police eventually traced Jay to a secluded property on Pheasant Walk. He was found safe and explained that he had been working on a personal project, losing track of time. Jay's family was relieved to hear he was unharmed, and no foul play was suspected."
