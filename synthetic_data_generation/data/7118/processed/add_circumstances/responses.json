Susan, who had been in foster care, was known to have mental health issues and had been experiencing instability in her living arrangements, often couch-surfing between friends and relatives. Her foster situation was known to some, including a close friend who realized Susan's absence and raised concern after she failed to respond to several calls. Gordon, a concerned neighbor, also noticed unusual activity around the residence. The combination of her mental health challenges and lack of stable housing contributed to Susan's temporary disappearance. Fortunately, she was safely located by police two days later in Burntisland."
