    "response": "narrative=Amanda Lyons was last seen by her grandmother at their family residence on Earl's Road, Grangemouth, FK3 8UZ, where she had been living comfortably. Her absence was a grave concern, as it was unusual for the otherwise responsible teenager to leave without notice. Amanda had been actively involved with a local volunteer organization, and it was believed she might have potentially joined a commune affiliated with the organization, driven by a growing fear of deportation affecting her family, despite their settled status. This fear, coupled with her impressionable age, might have prompted her to seek refuge elsewhere, possibly in another city. She was reported missing after a routine check found her belongings intact in the bathroom, heightening concerns about her sudden disappearance."
