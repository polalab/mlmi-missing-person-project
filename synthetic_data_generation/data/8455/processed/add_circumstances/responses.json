    "response": "narrative=Fiona Houghton, a 93-year-old with a history of cognitive challenges, was reported missing from her home on Castlecary Road. Normally active in her senior housing community, Fiona was last known to be attending a physical therapy session, but she never returned. Her brother, increasingly worried after she missed their weekly call, checked the nearby urban areas where Fiona enjoyed wandering. Reports came from witnesses who had seen her boarding a bus towards Cardross Road, G82 5DH, a route she took when attending her grandchild's school events. After a multi-day search, the police traced her to Fulton Road, G62 8PG. Fiona was found safe, albeit confused, in an area she frequently described as reminiscent of her childhood in Wrexham, bringing the incident to a relieved closure."
