    "response": "narrative=Bethany Barton, a 92-year-old retiree with a disability, was last seen leaving her home at 312 Greengairs Road, Greengairs, under mysterious circumstances. Her son reported her missing after realizing she had neither taken necessary medical supplies nor informed anyone of her plans. It was discovered the previous day, Bethany had attended a child custody-related meeting involving her granddaughter, Angela Norman. Neighbors noted seeing Bethany at a nearby synagogue, and later at a neighbor's house, appearing disoriented. After an extensive search, Bethany was located several days later by family members at an address on Craigieknowes Road, Perth. She was safe, although unsure of how she arrived there, attributing her disappearance to confusion."
