Known to frequent remote areas, Sandra often spoke of her need to unwind by exploring the natural landscapes surrounding her home in Dundee. It wasn't unusual for family members, including her father, to express concern over her solitary trips, given her love for hidden trails and unpopulated expanses. On the day Sandra went missing, she had mentioned feeling particularly restless and was planning to take a long drive to clear her mind. When she failed to return home that evening, her family alerted the authorities. Search efforts concentrated on rural outskirts and forested regions, taking advantage of her usual patterns. After several days of extensive searching, she was eventually traced to a friend’s residence, safe and unharmed.",,,restaurant,,"father,brother",,known to frequent remote areas,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0.0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,1,Her need to unwind in nature led to uncharacteristic prolonged absence.,1,Sandra intended to clear her mind with a long drive after feeling restless.,0,NULL,1,She planned a long drive but did not return as expected.,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL
