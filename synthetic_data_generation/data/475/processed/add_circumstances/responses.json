    "response": "narrative=Andrew Stanley, a 10-year-old boy, went missing from his home at 312 Greengairs Road after a heated argument with his brother led him to storm out in distress. Andrew, noted for his growing paranoia about being under surveillance, often felt he was being watched. His family noticed patterns of anxiety in the days leading up to the incident. Following the argument, Andrew was last seen by a neighbor heading towards the local ferry terminal, a spot he occasionally visited. Despite searches at the concert venue and nearby areas, no sign of him emerged. Days later, police traced Andrew to a bathroom at 9 Caroline Street. Thankfully, he was found safe and unharmed, though shaken by the ordeal."
