Prior to his disappearance, he had mentioned attending his grandchild's school events, although he never arrived. Leon's friend had previously expressed concern about his frequent wanderings due to age-related memory issues. On the day of his disappearance, a colleague, Mary Baker, had seen him leaving his doctor's office but couldn't accompany him. Upon investigation, police found clues suggesting Leon might have taken a wrong turn and ended up in the basement of an unfamiliar building while on a visit to a foreign country. Fortunately, he was later traced to Park Avenue, FK2 9LG, safe but disoriented.","school events,park,office","FK8,33 Spittal Street FK8 1DU","foreign country,basement",,"friend,colleague",colleague Mary Baker,,0,NULL,0,NULL,1,"He is 89 years old, which poses a vulnerability due to age.",0,NULL,1,He has age-related memory issues.,1,He has difficulty navigating unfamiliar places due to memory problems.,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,1,His disappearance patterns indicate he can become disoriented easily.,1,He intended to attend his grandchild's school events.,0,NULL,1,He failed to complete his intention of attending the school event.,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,NULL,1,He has age-related memory issues which affect his mental health.,0,NULL
