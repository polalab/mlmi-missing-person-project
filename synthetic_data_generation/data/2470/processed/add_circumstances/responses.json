    "response": "narrative=James Begum, a 15-year-old male, was reported missing from his home on Crossgatehead Road, Brightons. Known to use aliases in the past, James did not return from a walk he had set out on earlier, raising concerns among his family. His uncle, Alan Begum, mentioned that James often frequented the nearby roadhouse to meet friends, which was not unusual for him. However, he failed to check in as he usually did during his outings. Efforts to locate him intensified, with police tracing him to a part-time job at 35 Kerse Road, Grangemouth. The high-risk classification of his absence had prompted a swift response, leading to his safe return nearly four days after he vanished."
