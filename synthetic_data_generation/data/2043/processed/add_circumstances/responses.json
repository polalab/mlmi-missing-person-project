Joseph left his phone at 51 Grampian Court, increasing concerns as he had a habit of maintaining constant communication. Witnesses reported seeing him near an airport, raising suspicions of potential travel plans. Meanwhile, Joseph was being sought as a possible witness to a crime involving Shirley Edwards at a nearby hair salon. His last known movements included a visit to 60 South William Street, Perth, where he volunteered occasionally. He was eventually located safely by police at Balavil Brae."

    "response": "narrative=Joseph Thomas was last seen by his colleague at an orchard near Edinburgh Road, Perth, PH2 8DX, where he often consulted for work. He was supposed to meet his sister, Jacqueline Thomas, at the airport for a family trip, but never arrived. When Jacqueline couldn't reach him, she contacted their grandmother, worried that something child custody-related might have affected him as he had been supporting a friend through a legal situation. His friend confirmed his absence at their regular yoga class. Joseph was eventually traced by family members at 83 Burnside Avenue, having inadvertently lost track of time while assisting someone in need."
