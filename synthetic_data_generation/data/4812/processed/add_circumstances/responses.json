    "response": "narrative=Sharon Wilson was last seen around her home on Nicolton Avenue, displaying personality changes noticed by her foster father, Joshua Roberts, prior to her disappearance. Potentially upset by an incident at a school-related location, she later visited a shed located near 1-42 West Lodge Gardens, Alloa, FK10 2HX. Josephine, a close friend and colleague of Joshua, noted Sharon's interest in sea kayaking, which led to early speculations of a possible sea kayaking accident. Despite initial low-risk assessment, concern grew as the hours passed with no sign of Sharon. However, she was eventually traced safely at Earl's Road, Grangemouth, FK3 8UZ by police, indicating that her disappearance might have been an unplanned exploration prompted by recent changes in mood and surroundings."
