    "response": "narrative=Gerard Hooper was reported missing from his home on Turret Crescent. At the time of his disappearance, he had arrived home from his music lessons with colleague Jasmine Dobson, and was later supposed to head to a friend\u2019s house. Before leaving, Gerard seemed to have methodically disconnected utilities, perhaps to avoid detection. Initially unnoticed due to being a foster case, his absence raised alarms when neither colleagues nor friends, including Benjamin, could provide insight on his location. Traced by police after several days, he was eventually found safe but confused near an escalator at a shopping center on Balmuildy Road. His intentions for leaving remain unclear."

    "response": "narrative=Gerard Hooper, a 12-year-old boy, went missing following school after being dropped off by a colleague, Jasmine Dobson, at the Stirling Road, Dumbarton sports arena. Known to seek solitude, Gerard was reported by Jasmine as feeling overwhelmed during the drive. He was last seen near the youth center at the arena, where he expressed a desire for space from the crowd. Gerard then made his way to a friend's house at 85 Bassett Avenue, Glasgow, G13 3JP, where he sought refuge for several days. Not wanting his friends to worry, he stayed away from regular contact. He was eventually traced by the police to a quiet room at his friend\u2019s house, where he was found safe and unharmed, preferring the peaceful and supportive environment. His foster family was relieved to learn that he was found unharmed and had not been in any immediate danger."
