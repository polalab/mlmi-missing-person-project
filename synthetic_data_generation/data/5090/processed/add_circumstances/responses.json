Following this, Heather, known for her tendency to escape the constraints of routine by living off-grid, left her home. Reports from her friend suggested she might have been battling with suicidal ideation. Heather was last seen by a colleague of her foster father near the beach at Finavon Street, Dundee. Her disappearance triggered an immediate search operation. Two days later, she was found safe by staff at Unit 3 Fowler Road, Dundee, having sought solace away from her usual environment."

Her foster father noted her recent fascination with survival stories and some worrying expressions of suicidal ideation. Heather had been spending time with Karl Collier, a friend she trusted, and was last seen visiting his house. When she didn't return home, concerns grew rapidly due to her previous conversations and unusual interests. The search included possible common places such as Discovery Quay and nearby locations like the playground. Heather was eventually located by family at 3 Boniface Place, Dundee, safe but disoriented, indicating she might have sought seclusion as a response to her personal struggles."
