She was expected to meet her friend, Trevor Smith, but never arrived at the intended location. Her last known address was near the 55 Diana Avenue, Glasgow. Trevor, worried after Chloe failed to join him, checked the nearby skate park and her part-time job but found no trace of her. The search expanded to the surrounding roadhouse and areas Chloe often visited. Eventually, Chloe was located on a cruise ship docked at Acre Drive, Glasgow. A member of the public found her and reported it to the authorities, leading to her safe return.
