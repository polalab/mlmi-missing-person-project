Troubled by an ongoing identity crisis, Derek left abruptly, creating concerns among his family, including his sister and grandmother. His abrupt departure led him to wander aimlessly, eventually bringing him to a shopping mall, where he was seen by a friend who later reported his disoriented state. The friend described Derek's behavior as erratic and suggested he seemed to be searching for something or someone. Later, Derek visited a cemetery, where he spent several hours, perhaps in contemplation. A few days later, he was found by family in the basement of an abandoned building on Harbour Road, Inverness. Thankfully, he was unharmed, though visibly shaken, and returned home safely after receiving support."
